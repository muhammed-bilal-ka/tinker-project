# College Images System

## Overview
This system provides unique, high-quality images for all engineering colleges in Kerala using Unsplash as the image provider. The system ensures no image collisions and provides fallbacks for missing images.

## Features

- Images are assigned based on college name, type, and location
- Hash-based distribution ensures even spread

### ✅ **High-Quality Images**
- All images from Unsplash (free, high-quality)
- Optimized for web (800x600, compressed)
- Professional university/campus themed images

### ✅ **Smart Fallbacks**
- Automatic fallback images if primary image fails
- Type-based fallback selection (Government vs Private)
- Graceful error handling with placeholder icons

### ✅ **Performance Optimized**
- Lazy loading for better performance
- Image compression and optimization
- Cached images for faster loading

## Image Categories

### 🏛️ **Government Colleges**
