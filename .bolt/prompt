For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. You can install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc, when bringing them looks this website even more beautiful.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
Use card style as Glassmorphism, subtle rounded corners and soft drop shadows etc.. which must be consistebt layout to floating cards across all pages.
