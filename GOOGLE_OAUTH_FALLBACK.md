# Google OAuth Fallback Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the fallback mechanisms implemented for Google OAuth authentication in the SeekGram application to handle various edge cases and potential issues with the authentication flow.

## Implementation Details

### Multi-Tier Fallback Approach
The application now uses a three-tier approach to Google OAuth authentication:

1. **Primary Flow**: Standard OAuth flow with the configured redirect URI
2. **First Fallback**: Alternative redirect URI format using explicit callback path
3. **Second Fallback**: Uses Supabase's default callback handling without specifying a redirect URI

### Code Structure

The implementation is located in `src/lib/auth.ts` and consists of three main functions:

1. `signInWithGoogleEnhanced`: The main entry point that initiates the primary OAuth flow and handles fallbacks if needed
2. `googleOAuthFallback`: First fallback mechanism with alternative redirect URI format
3. `googleOAuthSecondFallback`: Second fallback mechanism using Supabase defaults

### Error Handling

Each tier includes comprehensive error handling and logging to help diagnose issues:

- Detailed console logging at each step
- Cascading fallback mechanism that tries all approaches before failing
- User-friendly error messages in the UI

## Usage

The enhanced Google OAuth flow is used in both the Login and SignUp components:

```typescript
const handleGoogleLogin = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  setError('');

  try {
    const result = await signInWithGoogle();
    
    // Handle result...
  } catch (err) {
    // Handle errors...
  }
};
```

## Common Issues Addressed

1. **Redirect URI Mismatch**: The fallback mechanisms try different redirect URI formats to handle potential mismatches between Supabase and Google Cloud Console configurations.

2. **Browser Redirect Issues**: The second fallback uses `skipBrowserRedirect: false` to ensure the browser properly redirects to Google's authentication page.

3. **User Feedback**: Improved error handling provides better feedback to users when authentication fails.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Google OAuth authentication:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error logs
2. Verify that the redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console match the ones used in the application
3. Ensure that the Supabase project has Google OAuth provider enabled
4. Verify that the environment variables are correctly set

## Future Improvements

- Add telemetry to track which fallback mechanism is being used
- Implement a more sophisticated retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Add support for additional OAuth providers with similar fallback mechanisms
